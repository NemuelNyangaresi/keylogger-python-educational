# Python Keylogger Project üö®

## üìú Description

This project demonstrates how to create a basic **keylogger** in Python using the `pynput` library. A keylogger is a program that records keystrokes entered by the user and stores them in a text file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Logs all keystrokes (letters, spaces, numbers, etc.).
- Outputs recorded keystrokes to a file (`keyfile.txt`).
- Lightweight and runs in the background.
- Demonstrates exception handling for unsupported keys.

# Steps Taken
Below are the key steps I followed to create the project, along with screenshots to demonstrate progress:
---
### Step 1: Install Dependencies<br />

- Installed `pynput using pip`.

---    
### Step 2: Create the Project Structure <br />

- Created a Python file: `keylogger.py`.

---
### Step 3: Write the Keylogger Code<br />

- Imported required libraries (`pynput`, `os`, `time`).
- Used a listener to log keys into a file.

---
### Step 4: Test the Script<br />

- Tested the script to ensure keys are logged correctly.
- Ensured the `key_log.txt` file is generated.

### Lessons Learned
What I learned during this project:

- Gained hands-on experience with Python libraries (pynput).
- Learned about file handling and background scripts.
- Improved debugging and problem-solving skills.
